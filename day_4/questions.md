#### 7. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?

Wow, so many looking into what functions can do i probably have to many questions for the capstone. I think most of my questions are going to be things we will cover later in classes, mostly how do we efficiently incorporate loops in functions to add more functionality to our programs. When to use certain function syntax over others?
